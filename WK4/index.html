            <h1>New Zeland</h1>
            <p id="1">
                <strong>New Zealand</strong> <em>(Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa])</em> is an island country in the
                southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the
                South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands, covering a total area of 268,021 square
                kilometres (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across
                the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The
                country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic
                uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is

            <p id="2">Owing to their remoteness, the islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable landmass to be
                settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then
                developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European
                to sight and record New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed
                the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became
                a colony within the British Empire, and in 1907 it became a dominion; it gained full statutory
                independence in 1947, and the British monarch remained the head of state. Today, the majority of New
                Zealand's population of 5.1 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest
                minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly
                derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased
                immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local
                dialect of English being dominant.
            </p>
            <p id="3">A developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national
                performance, such as quality of life, education, protection of civil liberties, government transparency,
                and economic freedom. New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed
                it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector dominates the national
                economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture. International tourism is also a significant
                source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament,
                while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister, currently
                Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's monarch and is represented by the governor-general.
                In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local
                government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook
                Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency,
                which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.

            <p id="4">Due to its large geographic size and natural resources, New Zealand is considered to be a
                significant regional power in the Pacific and a middle power in international affairs.[13][14][15][16]
                It is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, OECD, ASEAN Plus Six, Asia-Pacific
                Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
